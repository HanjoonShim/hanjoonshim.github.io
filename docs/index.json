SNUGLITE-III consists of two satellites developed in a standard 3U CubeSat configuration. These CubeSats aim to perform formation flying, collect GNSS Radio Occultation (GNSS-RO) data, and develop a precise orbit control system for rendezvous docking. To achieve these objectives, a robust and precise attitude determination and control system (ADCS) is essential. The ADCS of SNUGLITE-III comprises two modules: the primary system uses a star tracker for high precision attitude determination, while the secondary system incorporates Micro Electro Mechanical Systems sensors, including an Inertial Measurement Unit, sun sensor, magnetometer, and a GNSS receiver to act as a backup. This backup system is especially important during high angular velocity conditions, such as detumbling, or when the star tracker is unavailable. Although highly effective, GNSS-based attitude determination faces several challenges in CubeSats due to their limited space, which restricts antenna placement and reduces the number of visible satellites. Conventional GNSS-based methods rely on multiple antennas aligned in similar directions to maximize the number of visible satellites. However, CubeSats, especially those smaller than 3U, cannot easily accommodate multiple antennas with adequate separation. To overcome these limitations, we propose an algorithm that resolves GNSS carrier phase integer ambiguities every second, even with limited satellite visibility. The method utilizes the least squares ambiguity search technique (LSAST), combined with CubeSat-specific constraints such as baseline length and antenna arrangement, to reduce the search space and computational load. While LAMBDA, the most widely used method for integer ambiguity resolution, provides high accuracy, it requires significant computational resources, making it less suitable for CubeSats with limited onboard processing power. Our approach leverages the reduced computational requirements of LSAST and additional constraints to maintain reliable performance in real-time operations. Simulation analyses were conducted to evaluate the algorithm's performance under various conditions, including the number of visible satellites. The results demonstrate that the proposed method successfully resolves integer ambiguities and performs attitude determination every second, even with the limited resources available in CubeSats. This validates the effectiveness of the algorithm for real-time GNSS-based attitude determination in CubeSat missions like SNUGLITE-III, ensuring accurate orbit control and mission success.","tags":["SNUGLITE-III"],"title":"Efficient GNSS-Based Attitude Determination and Integer Ambiguity Resolution for 3U CubeSats","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hanjoon Shim","Bugyeom Kim","Yonghwan Bae","Changdon Kee"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1741392000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1741392000,"objectID":"a8bd428c51fb2ab2c08927a3c1e23854","permalink":"https://hanjoon.com/publication/ic_202501/","publishdate":"2025-03-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ic_202501/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper presents the first onboard Real-Time Kinematic (RTK)-based relative navigation system designed specifically for CubeSat rendezvous and docking missions.

Unlike conventional methods applied to medium and large satellites, this research focuses on autonomous missions utilizing low-cost, commercially-available CubeSat platforms. In this context, the design challenges for an efficient and reliable GPS relative navigation system are redefined to include issues related to hardware performance degradation, which are directly linked to the spatial limitations of the CubeSat platform. It is found that most existing relative navigation systems for CubeSats employ GPS only as a supplementary measurement and do not resolve the carrier phase integer ambiguities, making centimeter-level accuracy difficult to achieve through real-time ambiguity resolution.\nPrevious systems predominantly used algorithms that rely on electro-optical methods to recognize target satellites, often conservatively utilizing the relative position data provided by GPS receivers. By contrast, the proposed high-precision GPS relative navigation system aims to achieve real-time, centimeter-level accuracy using solely GPS receivers, thereby enhancing the operational capabilities of CubeSats in low Earth orbit (LEO). This system seeks to overcome the spatial limitations of CubeSats and fundamentally address the real-time ambiguity-fixing problems inherent in carrier phase measurements.\nThe approach begins with relative navigation between the chaser and target satellites using Differential GPS (DGPS), utilizing a Hatch filter to reduce noise. It then analyzes the statistical characteristics of the search space for carrier phase ambiguities derived from positional errors. However, the statistical characteristics of ambiguities based solely on DGPS are insufficient to utilize efficient search spaces such as those employed by linear combination techniques of multi-frequency carrier-phase measurements in ground-based Real-Time Kinematics (RTK) systems. Thus, the study combines these characteristics with the spatial characteristic index, Ambiguity Dilution of Precision (ADOP), to enhance the success rate of the LAMBDA method for carrier phase ambiguity resolution, thereby implementing RTK relative navigation. The LEO environment, with its many visible satellites and high-quality measurements, suggests that reliable ambiguity resolution with minimal computation is achievable–even with single-frequency measurements.\nAdditionally, a recursive filter for carrier phase ambiguity estimation, derived using weighted least squares from DGPS relative positions and observations, is introduced. This filter (similar to the nonlinear Kalman filter used in standard RTK) refines the ambiguity search range with updates solely from single-frequency measurements. Unlike conventional methods that rely on empirical estimates of carrier phase ambiguities through dynamic model time updates, this approach sequentially reflects the statistical characteristics of observed ambiguities from estimated initial relative positions. In this way, it is possible to narrow down the candidate search range and enhance the reliability of ambiguity resolution with minimal computational demand. Importantly, this also ensures a robust 100% success rate in resolving integer ambiguities, even with minimal satellite visibility, while minimizing residual errors and reducing the computational burden of ambiguity resolution.\nAnother advantage of the proposed system is its ability to detect cycle slips through the relative dynamics model between rendezvousing satellites, which facilitates the prediction of relative motion via orbit propagation–even in scenarios of communication failure. Relative accelerations derived from the linear relative motion model of closely operating CubeSats are used to determine cycle slips and predict the motion of the target satellite.\nIn order to demonstrate the utility of the proposed precise GPS relative navigation system, performance verification results from simulations in LEO and ground-based measurements are presented. The algorithm adapts to changes in the arrangement of GPS satellites caused by their high-speed maneuvering in orbit. Furthermore, hardware that corresponds to actual CubeSat platforms is used to predict and confirm both the resolution of ambiguities and the superior relative navigation performance–even under worst-case ground measurement scenarios. As a result, the proposed relative navigation system ensures both high accuracy of the single-frequency GPS receivers and high applicability for various missions because it is compatible with low-cost satellite platforms.","tags":null,"title":"Precise GPS Relative Navigation for CubeSat Rendezvous","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"For this project, an Engineering Model (EM) of the Interstage GSSB was developed.

To adapt the algorithm to the CubeSat platform and apply centimeter-level relative navigation using only singlefrequency measurements commonly available in GPS receivers for CubeSat, various performance degradation issues arise due to constraints imposed by the onboard systems, such as limited power, computing resources, and redundancy assurance. Therefore, when applying GPS-based precise relative navigation to CubeSat missions for autonomous formation flying and rendezvous docking, it is essential to consider the performance impact resulting from the hardware characteristics of the onboard computer, space GPS receiver, and GPS antenna. The relative navigation algorithm used in this application is developed based on a software GPS simulator in a LEO environment. Before validating the algorithm for satellite deployment, ground validation must be prioritized. In other words, understanding the differences between the LEO and ground environments and establishing a sequential verification procedure for the relative navigation algorithm are required. For this purpose, we aim to validate the developed precision relative navigation algorithm for CubeSats incrementally using measurements collected on the ground and analyze the actual hardware characteristics to achieve algorithm verification goal. To validate the utility of the proposed technique, we first verify the effectiveness of the developed CubeSat RTK relative navigation algorithm. Here, the algorithm's validation and performance are analyzed by utilizing actual measurements with reliable high-cost GPS receivers and antennas. Subsequently, hardware characteristics and performance analysis are conducted by sequentially applying GPS patch antennas and space GPS receivers installed on the CubeSat. Through the proposed technique, we demonstrate that SNUGLITE-III CubeSat relative navigation system can provide centimeter-level performance, even when considering the hardware characteristics of the CubeSat platform.","tags":["SNUGLITE-III"],"title":"Verification and Hardware Implementation of Single-Frequency RTK-Based Precise Relative Navigation for SNUGLITE-III CubeSat","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Overview Fit to Standard 3U Size CubeSats Two series-connected AzurSpace 3G30A solar cells Sun sensor and temperature sensor on a single PCB 1.2mm thick (Gomspace Interstage GSSB is compatible) In the SNUGLITE-III project, one of the main focus (to reduce budget) was on the fabrication of the solar panels for the CubeSat.

This paper presents the operational results of the SNUGLITE-II CubeSat, which were obtained during a 10-day period from July 3rd to July 12th. The data used for analysis were collected through the ground station located in Building 302 of Seoul National University, as well as from ground stations operated by SatNogs, a network of amateur radio enthusiasts. Additionally, satellite status information recorded by the ground station command was collected and classified chronologically. The collected data consists of beacon data transmitted by the SNUGLITE-II CubeSat at 10-second intervals in the UHF  band. It encompasses various information, including satellite uplink commands, GPS navigation data, power levels, attitude control, sensor measurements, temperature readings, and identification flags. By analyzing the collected data, the operational conditions of the SNUGLITE-II CubeSat were evaluated.

The inherent problem of magnetometer time-varying bias is typically addressed using compensation methods. Because compensation is performed in orbit, the application of such methods to HILS is difficult. In addition, the magnetorquer has limited applicability to HILS if only magnetorquers without reaction wheels or control moment gyroscopes are used. In general, HILS for CubeSat uses air bearing; however, it cannot be applied to a solely magnetorquer-based ADCS owing to the inertial moments and center of gravity effects induced by the air bearing table. To overcome these challenges, in this study, the magnetometer reliability is enhanced by compensating for temperature, current, and iron effects, which are modeled experimentally, in the pre-launch stage. Then, a novel single axis-based HILS for CubeSats is developed to minimize the disturbances by the ground environment. The torque limit of the magnetorquer is supplemented through a magnetic field generated by a Helmholtz cage. The proposed HILS environment is mathematically modeled to simulate the performance of the CubeSat ADCS, and its reliability is ensured by comparing the simulation with real-time experimental results. To validate the usefulness of the proposed HILS, it is applied to an ADCS based on a low-cost sensor fusion extended-Kalman filter and a linear quadratic regulator controller commonly used in CubeSats. The simulation and experimental results are well matched, demonstrating the potential of the proposed framework.","tags":["SNUGLITE-I"],"title":"Development of Hardware-In-the-Loop Simulation for CubeSat Platform: Focusing on Magnetometer and Magnetorquer","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jaeuk Park","Hanjoon Shim","Yonghwan Bae","Hojoon Jeong","Jikang Lee","Changdon Kee"],"categories":null,"content":"\r","date":1688083200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1688083200,"objectID":"de3dabf156ab0af470c98a5604037e70","permalink":"https://hanjoon.com/publication/dc_202304/","publishdate":"2023-06-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dc_202304/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["SNUGLITE-III"],"title":"Critical Design of Electrical Power Subsystem of SNUGLITE-III CubeSat","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hanjoon Shim","O-Jong Kim","Yonghwan Bae","Sunkyong Yu","Changdon Kee"],"categories":null,"content":"\r","date":1688083200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1688083200,"objectID":"fc63079247163bd7735f044f82729a03","permalink":"https://hanjoon.com/publication/dc_202303/","publishdate":"2023-06-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dc_202303/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["SNUGLITE-III"],"title":"Result of Satellite Telemetry Analysis of SNUGLITE-I CubeSat for 4 Years","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jaeuk Park","Hanjoon Shim","Yonghwan Bae","Changdon Kee"],"categories":null,"content":"\r","date":1682035200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1682035200,"objectID":"c6d00cab36144d27a619305982484445","permalink":"https://hanjoon.com/publication/dc_202302/","publishdate":"2023-04-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dc_202302/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["SNUGLITE-III"],"title":"Preliminary Design of Electrical Power Subsystem of SNUGLITE-III Cube Satellite","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yonghwan Bae","Hanjoon Shim","Jaeuk Park","Hojoon Jeong","Jikang Lee","Changdon Kee"],"categories":null,"content":"\r","date":1682035200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1682035200,"objectID":"09af20b7e5d0f6a1aca7a82312a7e4a4","permalink":"https://hanjoon.com/publication/dc_202301/","publishdate":"2023-04-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dc_202301/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["SNUGLITE-III"],"title":"Preliminary Design of SNUGLITE-III Cube-satellite for Formation Flight based GPS Radio Occultation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hanjoon Shim","O-Jong Kim","Sunkyoung Yu","Changdon Kee","Dong-Hyun Cho","Hae-Dong Kim"],"categories":null,"content":"\r","date":1680912000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1680912000,"objectID":"2e22422184fa5ae54b33fd35ba8233b7","permalink":"https://hanjoon.com/publication/ij_202301/","publishdate":"2023-04-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ij_202301/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper proposes a global positioning system (GPS) based relative navigation algorithm for CubeSats that perform autonomous rendezvous and docking missions.

To this end, a Hatch filter is used to improve the pseudorange noise performance, and range-domain DGPS-based single-frequency relative navigation is realized. Because GPS measurements are transmitted intermittently using an inter-satellite link, orbit propagation is performed using the Hill–Clohessy–Wiltshire equation. Moreover, to improve the performance of the propagation error accumulated over time, an in-orbit velocity moving average filter is incorporated. Because the rate change of relative motion in the local-vertical-local-horizontal coordinate system on the orbit is small, the noise level for the relative velocity and overall relative navigation system performance are improved.

SNUGLITE-II has been orbiting at an altitude of 700 km since its launch on June 21, 2022. The primary mission of SNUGLITE-II is real-time attitude determination using GPS only. For this mission, it is equipped with second generation of in-house developed GPS receiver which awarded flight heritage by SNUGLITE-I in 2018. This paper validates navigation performance of this second-generation receiver using orbit determination method and SNUGLITE-II data. Unlike ordinary CubeSats, beacon of SNUGLITE-II includes navigation solutions. Until communication was lost on July 13, navigation solutions in beacon data had been collected by tracking of ground stations and playback data. Since none of pseudorange or carrier phase observables were obtained, only navigation solutions are available for verification of receiver performance. While tracking from ground stations lasts about 10 minutes per pass, playback data provide full-orbit onboard navigation solutions. This new data provide wider visibility of the orbit and enabled m-level accuracy orbit determination with shorter observation time compared to the case of SNUGLITE-I where only ground-based data were available. With these navigation solutions, SNU Precise Orbit Determination (SNUPOD) tool is used to generate reference orbit for verification. Verification is performed by two type of test overlap test and middle arc test. In overlap test, reference orbits from different datasets are compared in overlapping interval to check the quality of them and then navigation solutions were evaluated by them. In middle arc test, intermediate data are excluded in reference orbit generation for independence and evaluated by the generated reference orbit. Results of two tests confirm that navigation performance of space GPS receiver on SNUGLITE-II is less than 10 m level.","tags":["SNUGLITE-II"],"title":"Verification of Space GPS Receiver Navigation Performance Based on Full-Orbit Navigation Solutions of CubeSat","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hanjoon Shim","Yonghwan Bae","Jaeuk Park","Changdon Kee"],"categories":null,"content":"\r","date":1668556800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1668556800,"objectID":"2f7abf7d75c5b5c35204894fd2c0c0c4","permalink":"https://hanjoon.com/publication/dc_202201/","publishdate":"2022-11-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dc_202201/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["SNUGLITE-III"],"title":"Initial Operation Result of SNUGLITE-II Cube-Satellite","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hanjoon Shim","O-Jong Kim","Sunkyong Yu","Yonghwan Bae","Changdon Kee"],"categories":null,"content":"\r","date":1668556800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1668556800,"objectID":"f4d60250f39691c0d26e1c2c6c79dc5b","permalink":"https://hanjoon.com/publication/dc_202203/","publishdate":"2022-11-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dc_202203/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["SNUGLITE-III"],"title":"Rendezvous Technology of SNU CubeSat (SNUGLITE-III) Using Only GPS Receivers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yonghwan Bae","Hanjoon Shim","Jaeuk Park","Hojoon Jeong","Junwon Song","Changdon Kee"],"categories":null,"content":"\r","date":1668556800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1668556800,"objectID":"846114debd3fd3f18b420b7041fcc36c","permalink":"https://hanjoon.com/publication/dc_202202/","publishdate":"2022-11-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dc_202202/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["SNUGLITE-III"],"title":"SNUGLITE-II Cubesat Ground Station Configuration and Ground Operation Test","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"작지만 강한 ‘큐브위성’ 뜬다… “세계시장 발맞춰 기술력 강화해야” Title: Small but strong ‘cube satellite’ is emerging… “Technical capabilities must be strengthened to keep pace with the global market” Source: 동아일보 (DongA) Language: Korean ","date":1663891200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1663891200,"objectID":"7d6f5a87b6c3103eb8aa6d0df09fbedd","permalink":"https://hanjoon.com/event/220923-%EB%8F%99%EC%95%84%EC%9D%BC%EB%B3%B4/","publishdate":"2022-09-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/event/220923-%EB%8F%99%EC%95%84%EC%9D%BC%EB%B3%B4/","section":"event","summary":"- **Title: Small but strong ‘cube satellite’ is emerging… “Technical capabilities must be strengthened to keep pace with the global market”**\n- Source: 동아일보 (DongA)\n- Language: Korean\n- Tag: SNUGLITE-II","tags":["media","SNUGLITE-II"],"title":"Media Report on Sep 23, 2022","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"누리호에 쏘아 올린 그들의 열정 Title: Their passion launched into Nuri Source: 대학신문 Language: Korean ","date":1662249600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1662249600,"objectID":"d032162b8509e6e3f6cce4d90e0268f3","permalink":"https://hanjoon.com/event/220904-snu/","publishdate":"2022-09-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/event/220904-snu/","section":"event","summary":"- **Title: Their passion launched into Nuri**\n- Source: 대학신문\n- Language: Korean\n- Tag: SNUGLITE-II","tags":["media","SNUGLITE-II"],"title":"Media Report on Sep 4, 2022","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"!

Since the ionospheric error of GPS measurement is variable depending on the visible satellites, a few meters error of relative navigation is occurred in the Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) environment. Therefore, it is essential to remove the ionospheric error to perform relative navigation. Besides, an intermittent communication period for receiving GPS measurements of the target satellite is limited for getting information every sampling time. To solve this problem, a method combining range domain DGPS and orbit propagation is proposed in this paper. The proposed method improves the performance of DGPS by using Hatch filter and solves an intermittent communication problem by estimating the relative position and velocity using Hill-Clohessy-Wiltshire Equation. Through the simulation, it is verified that the suggested algorithm provides the relative position error within RMS 0.5 m and the relative velocity error within RMS 3 cm/s. Furthermore, it has the advantage that it is suitable for real-time implementation using single-frequency GPS measurements and is computationally efficient.","tags":["KARDSAT"],"title":"Single

Since launch, the SNUGLITE CubeSat has continuously broadcast in-orbit status information. In this study, a methodology for the analysis of in-orbit attitude estimation results using received data is presented, and this was achieved by comparing two sun-pointing vectors, i.e., the sun-pointing vector calculated using estimated attitude with the positions of the sun and the satellite and the reference vector generated by the power levels of the solar panels. Because the satellite position was required for the attitude analysis, the verification of the performance of the own-developed on-board Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver is also briefly described. Analyses indicate that the attitude estimation of the SNUGLITE CubeSat has achieved an in-orbit real-time pointing accuracy with a root mean square of 6.1°.","tags":["SNUGLITE-I"],"title":"In-Orbit Results and Attitude Analysis of the SNUGLITE Cube-Satellite","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sunkyoung Yu","O-Jong Kim","Hanjoon Shim","Yonghwan Bae","Changdon Kee","Hakdu Kim","Jungchul Lee","Jinhee Han","Sanghyuck Han","Yeonju Choi","Wonsup Choi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1579564800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1579564800,"objectID":"a0cecd5178687b22c882b5fda767feaa","permalink":"https://hanjoon.com/publication/ic_202001/","publishdate":"2020-01-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ic_202001/","section":"publication","summary":"SNUGLITE(Seoul National University GNSS Laboratory Satellite) is 2U-size Low Earth Orbit (LEO) CubeSat (U-class spacecraft). Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS) of CubeSat is designed to maintain its attitude at the Earth pointing. For determining satellite's attitude, Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) algorithm were applied. Specifically, multiple sensors - dual frequency GPS receiver, 3-axis gyroscope, magnetometer and sun sensors - were used with models Jet Propulsion Laboratory sun reference Development Ephemeris (JPL DE405) and International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF12). Moreover, 3-axis magnetorquer was used as a single actuator. Generally, the verification of ADCS algorithm starts from software-in-the-loop simulation (SILS) developed and verified in software tools such as MATLAB. After verification of SILS, Processor-in-the-Loop simulation (PILS) is required to verify the ADCS algorithm implementing in the processor of On Board Computer (OBC) in C-language. Finally, satellite’s ADCS algorithm is needed to be verified experimentally by hardware-in-the-loop simulation (HILS) in the space-like environment under a ground-based setting using a massive simulator. Most of satellite attitude HILS is composed of sensors such as air-bearings, Helmholtz coil, and array sun sensors. In this paper, to verify ADCS algorithm in HILS, the precise attitude estimation, modeling and calibration of sensors (magnetometer, gyroscope and coarse sun sensor) are presented. In addition, a low-cost single-axis HILS verification method is proposed using simple testbed hanging CubeSat with a wire. By using the Earth’s magnetic field on the ground and the light from Halogen lamp, the space environment has been implemented on the ground in order to verify attitude determination and control performance in a single axis. In conclusion, the results of the HILS ensure that the performance of the proposed algorithm meets the estimation and the control requirements of the SNUGLITE.","tags":["SNUGLITE-I"],"title":"Verification of Space GPS Receiver Navigation Performance Using a Cube Satellite","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hanjoon Shim","O-Jong Kim","Yonghwan Bae","Jungbeom Kim","Changdon Kee"],"categories":null,"content":"\r","date":1574380800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1574380800,"objectID":"992e81c118c7e9835693839e05ad0444","permalink":"https://hanjoon.com/publication/dc_201905/","publishdate":"2019-11-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dc_201905/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["SNUGLITE-I"],"title":"Design of Helmholtz Cage for Verification of Attitude Determination and Control System SNUGLITE Cube-Satellite","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hojoon Jeong","Jongju Kim","Sunkyong Yu","O-Jong Kim","Yonghwan Bae","Hanjoon Shim","Changdon Kee"],"categories":null,"content":"\r","date":1574380800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1574380800,"objectID":"b3904b93c11e7d93d9625d8b01ea12dc","permalink":"https://hanjoon.com/publication/dc_201906/","publishdate":"2019-11-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dc_201906/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["SNUGLITE-I"],"title":"Orbit Determination and Performance Analysis by Using Navigation Solution Received from SNUGLITE Cube Satellite","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yonghwan Bae","Hanjoon Shim","Sunkyong Yu","Donguk Kim","O-Jong Kim","Changdon Kee"],"categories":null,"content":"\r","date":1572480000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572480000,"objectID":"4312790485e7ea2abec26f1970ea0093","permalink":"https://hanjoon.com/publication/dc_201903/","publishdate":"2019-10-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dc_201903/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["SNUGLITE-II"],"title":"Attitude Determination of Cube-Satellite using Multiple GPS Antennas","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hanjoon Shim","Sunkyong Yu","O-Jong Kim","Changdon Kee","Dong-Hyun Cho","Hae-Dong Kim"],"categories":null,"content":"\r","date":1572480000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572480000,"objectID":"c5eb5841ae7f8191d1021c04366e719d","permalink":"https://hanjoon.com/publication/dc_201904/","publishdate":"2019-10-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dc_201904/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["KARDSAT"],"title":"Relative Navigation for Autonomous Rendezvous and Docking of Nano-Satellite Based on DGPS","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\rSummary Seoul National University GNSS Laboratory Satellite (SNUGLITE)-II Project\rParticipation\r2019–2022\rRole\rProject Manager, System/FSW/ACS/AIT Engineer\r3U CubeSat mission (Launch: Jun 2022)\rFunded by Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI) ($330,000 USD)\rFinalist in the 2019 Korea CubeSat Competition\rThe SNUGLITE-II CubeSat was selected as a finalist in the “2019 CubeSat Competition” organized by the Korea Aerospace Research Institute, receiving a total funding of 475 million KRW. The primary mission was to develop the second generation of the dual-frequency L1/L2C GPS receiver, which was originally developed in the SNUGLITE-I CubeSat project. The project aimed to improve the quality of millimeter-level carrier phase measurements and to miniaturize the receiver. Using this advanced GPS receiver, the mission included conducting 3D Earth atmospheric observations through GPS Radio Occultation (RO). Technological objectives included the world’s first stand-alone GPS-based attitude determination system implemented in a 3U CubeSat, as well as the development of an indigenous reaction wheel-based attitude control system. SNUGLITE-II was a standard 3U CubeSat, launched aboard South Korea’s first indigenous orbital launch vehicle, the Nuri (KSLV-II), as part of the performance verification satellite payload in a P-POD, on June 21, 2022. After approximately 11 days of nominal operation in commissioning mode and receiving partial mission data via UHF bi-directional communication, a sudden loss of communication occurred, leading to the official end of the mission.

The primary objectives of this mission include the development of technologies for rendezvous and docking of nano-satellites, state estimation of space objects, recognition of target objects using deep learning techniques, the development of atmospheric drag augmentation devices for satellite disposal, a compact docking mechanism for microsatellites, precise relative navigation technology (electro-optcal and GPS based), and inter-satellite link technologies for close-proximity (km-level) satellite operations. The GPS-based relative navigation technology, which is essential for precise relative navigation, was entrusted to the GNSS Laboratory at Seoul National University. This CubeSat was intended to be launched on the Korean launch vehicle (KSLV-II, Nuri) in 2022; however, the satellite was not launched, and only the technology development was carried out. A national report on the relevant technology is available here.\nThis project was conducted from 2019 to 2020. As the first doctoral student involved in this project, I served as the Project Manager, handling all aspects from documentation to practical implementation, with guidance from one postdoctoral researcher. I was responsible for the following tasks: designing a decimeter-level GPS relative navigation system for KARDSAT, conducting MATLAB SILS simulations, and performing C-based PILS to deliver the flight code.

Operation Scenario The Chaser is equipped with thrusters for orbital control, visual sensors for shape recognition and attitude estimation of the Target, and a docking device for demonstration purposes. The Target features an LED marker to facilitate the Chaser’s attitude estimation and a drag device for deorbiting after mission completion. Upon deployment from the P-POD, the two satellites will gradually drift apart due to orbital perturbations, estimated to reach a distance of approximately 500 km within three days until they establish communication for orbital control. After the first contact, the Chaser will perform orbital maneuvers to approach the Target, controlled by commands from the ground station until they are about 2 km apart. Within this range, relative navigation and control will bring them closer to within approximately 10 meters. The Target will transmit its orbital information to the Chaser, which will estimate the relative distance and execute the necessary maneuvers. Once within 10 meters, the Chaser will use its visual sensors for shape recognition and state estimation before initiating docking control. After successful docking, the Chaser will immediately detach and use its remaining fuel to lower its altitude, while the Target will deploy its drag device.\nThis research project aims to develop a relative GPS system for KARDSAT, utilized during Tests #1 to #5 as shown in the diagrams, with a requirement to achieve sub-meter real-time GPS relative navigation and deliver flight code as the project’s goal.\n2.

Unlike ordinary satellites equipped with reaction wheels, only a magnetorquer is mounted on cube-satellite due to spatial constraints. It is a simple, low-weight, and low-power consumption actuator that enables efficient operation of cube-satellite and aims to maintain nadir-pointing control. In order to achieve the objective of the proposed system, firstly, the equations of motion for the cube-satellite is expressed in terms of the gravity gradient torque, and the input torque calculated from the dipole moment of the magnetorquer and geomagnetic field. Then, a linear system model is obtained by interpreting the uncertainty flowing into the system as noise sources. In addition, extended Kalman filter equations are derived to estimate the attitude of the cube-satellite by defining the reference vector from the sun and magnetic field model, and fusing the sun sensor, magnetometer, and gyroscope measurements. Then, LQR controller can be designed to maintain nadir-pointing by calculating the optimal solution from the cost function composed of a given linear system and input. In order to verify the performance of the proposed system, HILS should be performed considering various constraints of the ground environment. However, it is difficult to verify the above-described system in a ground environment due to limitations in the performance of magnetorquer such as small input torque effected by the magnitude of the geomagnetic field, and decoupled input control. So far, it has been studied that the verification of cube-satellite ADCS for the stabilization of angular velocity, the passive control method which depends on geomagnetic field alignment, and HILS using reaction wheels. HILS of ADCS using only magnetorquer also has been proposed, but the performance analysis was limited due to the constraints of the ground environment. In contrast, the proposed HILS is aimed at verifying magnetorquer mounted cube-satellite ADCS that solves the limitations from unknown error factors of the ground environment. Therefore, in this thesis, HILS verification of cube-satellite ADCS using Helmholtz cage is proposed. It is focused on output characteristics proportional to the magnitude of the external magnetic field of the magnetorquer. In other words, it is solved by controlling the magnetic field vector generated from Helmholtz cage that is the degradation of the estimation performance due to the magnetic field including the statistical error characteristic in the indoor environment and the control performance deterioration due to the small input torque of the magnetorquer which is vulnerable to the disturbance. To construct a magnetic field vector from Helmholtz cage, it is designed using the Biot-Savat law to model the current-magnetic field relationship. Also, it is designed to have a size enough to ensure the magnetic field uniformity of the space including the cube-satellite. The magnetic field vector controller of Helmholtz cage can be easily designed by approximating the transfer function from the derived current-magnetic field equation and using the classical control technique. In this case, cube-satellite is suspended in the inner space of Helmholtz cage to perform single axis HILS verification of ADCS. Since the GPS measurement value cannot be calculated in the indoor experiment environment, the nadir-pointing reference vectors are redefined by the mean measurement values of the simulated sunlight and the magnetic field generated from Helmholtz cage. Then, by defining a coordinate system based on the Helmholtz cage in the proposed HILS environment, nadir-pointing control performance can be expected by the computer simulation. Based on these simulation results, the proposed system can be verified by comparison with actual experimental results. To demonstrate the validity of the proposed method, a single axis HILS verification of ADCS using SNUGLITE cube-satellite is presented. The proposed method can verify the performance of nadir-pointing control on the ground by using only the magnetorquer which is typically installed in cube-satellite. It is also confirmed that the estimation performance and the control reliability of ADCS can be verified effectively compared with the method which does not utilize Helmholtz cage. The proposed HILS verification technique is expected to be used for verification of cube-satellite ADCS for various tasks due to its simplicity and practicality.","tags":null,"title":"HILS Verification of Low Earth Orbit Cube-Satellite Attitude Determination and Control System Using Helmholtz Cage","type":"publication"},{"authors":["O-Jong Kim","Hanjoon Shim","Minhuck Park","Yonghwan Bae","Sunkyong Yu","Bonggwan Choi","Seonho Kang","Changdon Kee"],"categories":null,"content":"\r","date":1543536000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1543536000,"objectID":"3f14db8a4532d014106fd2f3012a2142","permalink":"https://hanjoon.com/publication/dc_201803/","publishdate":"2018-11-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dc_201803/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["SNUGLITE-I"],"title":"Development and Launch Preparation of SNUGLITE Cube-satellite Observing Space Weather and Earthquake using GNSS signals","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yonghwan Bae","Sunkyong Yu","O-Jong Kim","Hanjoon Shim","Hwigyeom Kim","Changdon Kee"],"categories":null,"content":"\r","date":1543536000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1543536000,"objectID":"4880344a832f5b294d4838266e0f30fe","permalink":"https://hanjoon.com/publication/dc_201804/","publishdate":"2018-11-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dc_201804/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["SNUGLITE-I"],"title":"SNUGLITE Cubesat Ground Station Communication and Control System Operation Test","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hanjoon Shim","Minhuck Park","O-Jong Kim","Sunkyong Yu","Heekwon No","Changdon Kee"],"categories":null,"content":"\r","date":1541116800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1541116800,"objectID":"7baac62b806b2d9ca88f20fb0e5b5f61","permalink":"https://hanjoon.com/publication/dc_201802/","publishdate":"2018-11-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dc_201802/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["SNUGLITE-I"],"title":"운용 시나리오를 고려한 SNUGLITE 큐브위성의 자세결정 및 제어 시스템 지상환경 HILS","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Heekwon No","Hanjoon Shim","Jungbeom Kim","Changdon Kee"],"categories":null,"content":"\r","date":1524182400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1524182400,"objectID":"d8f08c1efb401386488c0996ee17877b","permalink":"https://hanjoon.com/publication/dc_201801/","publishdate":"2018-04-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dc_201801/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Altitude Estimation by Integrating Barometer with Accelerometer","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Minkyu Choi","Sunkyoung Yu","O-Jong Kim","Heekwon No","Hanjoon Shim","Changdon Kee"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1517184000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1517184000,"objectID":"febbd0d6eda5191977fb9a2c9eddbdb4","permalink":"https://hanjoon.com/publication/ic_201801/","publishdate":"2018-01-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ic_201801/","section":"publication","summary":"This study demonstrates the validation of the in-house developed space GPS receiver using a cube satellite called Seoul National University GNSS satelLITE (SNUGLITE). SNUGLITE is orbiting at an altitude of 575km since its launch date Dec. 4th, 2018. The main mission of SNUGLITE is to verify the space GPS receiver. This paper validated the performance of space GPS receiver to clarify the mission success using SNUGLITE data and orbit determination method. SNUGLITE broadcasts its navigation solutions using a beacon, every 10 seconds, but none of the pseudo-range or carrier phase observations are transmitted because of the failure of the communication receiver part. Therefore, only navigation solutions could be used to verify space receiver performance. Onboard navigation solutions are collected during antenna tracking by stations and the tracking lasts about 10 minutes per each station. Despite the data environment, an orbit could be determined in m-level accuracy using data of a few arcs and the SNU Precise Orbit Determination (SNUPOD) tool. In the verification method, the verification was performed by selecting one arc within the dataset and excluding it from the creation of the reference orbit so that the arc and the reference orbit had an independent relationship. A simulation was conducted to show the feasibility of the verification process and real data experiments were assessed the accuracy of SNUGLITE navigation data. The result shows that the verification process is enough to validate m-level accuracy and SNUGLITE space GPS receiver performance is about 6 m. In conclusion, it is confirmed that SNUGLITE satisfies the requirements of its main mission.","tags":["SNUGLITE-I"],"title":"Development and Verification of Attitude Determination and Control Algorithm for SNUGLITE Cube Satellite","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Minkyu Choi","Jooyoung Jang","Sunkyoung Yu","O-Jong Kim","Hanjoon Shim","Changdon Kee"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1513296000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1513296000,"objectID":"89857ca6d284751ff8371cccbc3d16bf","permalink":"https://hanjoon.com/publication/dj_201701/","publishdate":"2017-12-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dj_201701/","section":"publication","summary":"A 2U cube satellite called SNUGLITE has been developed by GNSS Research Laboratory in Seoul National University. Its main mission is to perform actual operation by mounting dual-frequency global positioning system (GPS) receivers. Its scientific mission aims to observe space environments and collect data. It is essential for a cube satellite to control an Earth-oriented attitude for reliable and successful data transmission and reception. To this end, an attitude estimation and control algorithm, Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS), has been implemented in the on-board computer (OBC) processor in real time. In this paper, the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) was employed as the attitude estimation algorithm. For the attitude control technique, the Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) was utilized. The algorithm was verified through the processor in the loop simulation (PILS) procedure. To validate the ADCS algorithm in the ground, the experimental verification via a single axis Hardware-in-the-loop simulation (HILS) was used due to the simplicity and cost effectiveness, rather than using the 3-axis HILS verification (Schwartz et al. 2003) with complex air-bearing mechanism design and high cost.","tags":["SNUGLITE-I"],"title":"Single-Axis Hardware in the Loop Experiment Verification of ADCS for Low Earth Orbit Cube-Satellite","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hanjoon Shim","Minkyu Choi","Sunkyong Yu","O-Jong Kim","Changdon Kee"],"categories":null,"content":"\r","date":1510876800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1510876800,"objectID":"082314c10fd8372f16ef31f8809751f0","permalink":"https://hanjoon.com/publication/dc_201702/","publishdate":"2017-11-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dc_201702/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["SNUGLITE-I"],"title":"Single-Axis Attitude Determination and Control System HILS Considering Ground Environment of SNUGLITE Cube-Satellite using Magnetoquer","type":"publication"},{"authors":["O-Jong Kim","Sanghoon Jeon","Sunkyong Yu","Minkyu Choi","Hwigyeom Kim","Hanjoon Shim","Bonggwan Choi","Seonho Kang","Changdon Kee"],"categories":null,"content":"\r","date":1507852800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1507852800,"objectID":"e708f38f2bd93950f183a42f7e441086","permalink":"https://hanjoon.com/publication/dc_201701/","publishdate":"2017-10-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dc_201701/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["SNUGLITE-I"],"title":"위성항법 신호를 이용하여 우주환경관측 및 지진관측 수행을 위한 저궤도 큐브위성 개발","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\rSummary Seoul National University GNSS Laboratory Satellite (SNUGLITE)-I Project\rParticipation\r2017–2019\rRole\rADCS Engineer\r2U CubeSat mission (Launch: Dec 2018)\rFunded by Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI) ($205,000 USD)\rFinalist in the 2015 Korea CubeSat Competition\rThe SNUGLITE-I CubeSat was selected as a finalist in the “2015 CubeSat Competition” organized by the Korea Aerospace Research Institute, with a total funding of 275 million KRW. The main mission was to develop a dual-frequency L1/L2C GPS receiver for CubeSats and use GPS Radio Occultation (RO) to model the ionosphere. Launched in December 2018, SNUGLITE-I is still broadcasting beacons, but due to a failure in the communication module’s receiver, uplink functionality is currently unavailable.

As an Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS) engineer, I was responsible for the following tasks. These were based on knowledge passed down from previous graduate students, and I implemented the algorithms developed in MATLAB into C and conducted the integration and testing.

CubeSat GPS L1/L2C Receiver Due to a failure in the communication module’s uplink, the primary mission of the SNUGLITE-I CubeSat could not be fully verified, resulting in a partial success. However, the GPS receiver development, the core mission of SNUGLITE-I, was successfully completed. The beacon transmits navigation information every 10 seconds, and this data has been used for orbit determination, successfully validating the GPS receiver.\n3.2. ADCS After launch and ejection from P-POD, SNUGLITE-I successfully damped its angular velocity and entered standby mode. The satellite has been performing nadir-pointing control in standby mode. Using attitude data received via the beacon, the ADCS was indirectly evaluated, demonstrating approximately 15° accuracy in attitude determination and control, achieved solely using magnetorquers without reaction wheels.\nFor more details, refer to the paper on in-orbit results here.\nFor more information, refer to the related publications below. :) ","date":1488326400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1488326400,"objectID":"2e7ffe26219ce382572646762ac57f8f","permalink":"https://hanjoon.com/project/snuglite-i/","publishdate":"2017-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/snuglite-i/","section":"project","summary":"2U CubeSat mission (Launch: Dec 2018)","tags":["SNUGLITE-I"],"title":"(2017-2019) SNUGLITE-I","type":"book"},{"authors":["Hanjoon Shim","Yong-Jin Kim","Jae-Hong Lee","Won-Sang Ra"],"categories":null,"content":"\r","date":1437004800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1437004800,"objectID":"cf5e2a7580457948af68206b68438e86","permalink":"https://hanjoon.com/publication/dc_201501/","publishdate":"2015-07-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dc_201501/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Vertical Channel Damping Loop Design for Autonomous Vehicle with Altitude Controller","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"3c42bb4157bf51d85ae7ffc4e1685909","permalink":"https://hanjoon.com/projects/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/projects/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"project","type":"book"}]
