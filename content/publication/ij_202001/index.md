abstract: SNUGLITE (Seoul National University Global navigation satellite system Laboratory satellITE) is a two-unit cube satellite (CubeSat) with dimensions 10 × 10 × 23 cm that requires an attitude system for missions and ground station telecommunication. A linear-quadratic-Gaussian-based optimal attitude system for the CubeSat platform has been developed using low-cost sensors, with the in-orbit verification of the attitude system being is one of main study objectives. Since launch, the SNUGLITE CubeSat has continuously broadcast in-orbit status information. In this study, a methodology for the analysis of in-orbit attitude estimation results using received data is presented, and this was achieved by comparing two sun-pointing vectors, i.e., the sun-pointing vector calculated using estimated attitude with the positions of the sun and the satellite and the reference vector generated by the power levels of the solar panels. Because the satellite position was required for the attitude analysis, the verification of the performance of the own-developed on-board Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver is also briefly described. Analyses indicate that the attitude estimation of the SNUGLITE CubeSat has achieved an in-orbit real-time pointing accuracy with a root mean square of 6.1°.
