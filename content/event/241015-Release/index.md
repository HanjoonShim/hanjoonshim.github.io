I’m excited to announce that my research website is now live! 

The site serves as a hub for sharing updates on my projects, publications, and other academic activities. 
This platform is designed to showcase my work in spacecraft navigation and CubeSat technologies, with the goal of connecting with fellow researchers and enthusiasts in the field.
Feel free to explore, and I’d love to hear your feedback!
